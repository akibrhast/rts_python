This repository contains a coding  excercise by RTS Labs. The coding excercise contains three questions which are listed below

1. Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

```python
def n_above_inputs(array: list,value:int) -> dict:
    '''
    Print's the number of integer array that are above the given input value
    and the number that are below the input value
    '''

    return result

print(n_above_inputs([1, 5, 2, 1, 10],6)) 
# prints: {"above":1,"below":4}
```


2. Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.

```python
def rotate_string(string_value, input_value):
    '''
    Rotate the characters in a string by a given input 
    and have the overflow appear at the beginning
    '''
    return result

print(rotate_string("MyString", 2))
# prints: "mgMyStri"
```

3. If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?
